# optimize_campaign

This solution isn't exact, but rather is based on assumptions about which solutions are the most likely. You can make small changes in the code if higher precision is requred (but then it will also be more computationally intensive). The precision is sufficiently high to give optimal solution in most cases (or approximately optimal solution in edge cases). 

In the project folder, there is a file called `input1.txt`, `input2.txt`, etc. Each such file is input for a test case. You use the program by entering for example `cargo run input3.txt` in the terminal, and in that case the working directory needs to be equal to the project folder. If you want to apply other test cases, then you can insert more input folders of same format as `input1.txt`, etc.
